[**The site is deployed here via Netlify**](https://connerpinson.com)

This website was built from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript as a way to host myself online as well as train my web development skills.

The code breakdown on GitHub says it's just CSS and HTML but there's a decent amount of JavaScript in a `<script>` tag in `index.html`

## Desktop
For desktop users, text will fade in as you hover over the icons

## Mobile
For mobile users, an animation will play that will walk you through the highlights and subtitles.
