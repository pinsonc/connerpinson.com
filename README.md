I started building this from scratch starting with my general CS knowledge and a book on HTML5 and CSS3 around 1pm and had everything finished up at about 1am.

The code breakdown on GitHub says it's just CSS and HTML but there's a decent amount of JavaScript in a `<script>` tag in `index.html`

Keeping the repo public in case anyone wants to get some inspiration from this (even though you can just `Inspect Element`...)

## Desktop
For desktop users, text will fade in as you hover over the icons

## Mobile
For mobile users, an animation will play that will walk you through the highlights and subtitles.

If I'm being honest, I think I ended up liking the mobile version more.
